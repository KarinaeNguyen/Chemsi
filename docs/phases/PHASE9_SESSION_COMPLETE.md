## Confidence Assessment 🎯

| Area | Level | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Phase 8 Solid | 🟢 Excellent | 62/62 tests, 7/7 scenarios |
| Phase 9 Designed | 🟢 Excellent | 5 tracks planned, all designs done |
| Materials Ready | 🟢 Excellent | All docs, skeletons, guides created |
| Implementation Path | 🟢 Excellent | Proven TDD methodology, clear patterns |
| Timeline Realistic | 🟢 Excellent | 3 weeks Track A, 12-16 weeks full |
| **Overall** | **🟢 EXCELLENT** | **READY TO LAUNCH** |

---

## Important Reminders 💡

### Test-Driven Development
Always write tests **BEFORE** implementation:
1. Write test
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Verify all 62+ tests still pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit with message

### Code Quality
- [ ] No compiler warnings
- [ ] No compiler errors
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not "what"
- [ ] Code follows existing style

### Integration Pattern
- Phase 8: Single zone + CFD interface
- Phase 9A: Add radiation model
- Phase 9B+: Add other tracks
- Each track should work independently first

### Performance Targets
- View factors: < 5ms
- Heat flux: < 0.01ms per call
- Total per step: < 100ms
- Per simulation: < 10s for 60s
